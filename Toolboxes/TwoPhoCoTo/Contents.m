% 
% The TwoPhotonCorrelationToolbox (TwoPhoCoTo) is a collection of Matlab
% functions you can use to perform correlation related data-processing on
% two-photon calcium data. 
% 
% In the toolbox folder you can find a pdf that lists and describes the
% functions included in TwoPhoCoTo, although this pdf is often already
% outdated the day after it gets updated. Please refer to the individual
% functions for the most recent information.
% 
% The most useful function and workhorse of most wrapper-functions in the
% toolbox is called processActivityMatrix.m and can be found in the
% \TwoPhoCoTo\low-level-functions\ directory.
